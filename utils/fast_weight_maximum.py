    """
    Why this class exists?

    This class is used to speed up the process of calculating the outline.
    It is used in the outline_complete.py file, where the outline is calculated.

    The outline calculation is a very time-consuming process.
    Worst part was related to access to getable fields in the WeightMaximum model.
    It's very magic how field __get__ and __set__ methods are resolved in Django ORM,
    and it's really slow. It's completely not designed for such a high number of accesses.
