### Creating Shipments

This tab is used to create a collective Shipment from the results of multiple Overviews. Each player receives a unique link with long random 'token' in the URL, such as:
<br>
<br>

<pre>
https://plemiona-planer.pl/en/overview/paQ4EJDAroDVWFmbKh407Ec_nL682tLH7zsXydjx_I4
</pre>

As a result of creating outlines in the <b>My outlines</b> tab by the off coordinator.

The links can be combined here and sent using the prepared table.

For example:

- **paQ4EJDAroDVWFmbKh407Ec_nL682tLH7zsXydjx_I4**
- **0TSGIUGV_VHTTlGF6LyJS5nG-M72EtmjV8pnTmN4mY8**

With the selected name, it will combine two Outlines into one Shipment.

### Errors

Requirements are:
- Correct (existing) result tokens
