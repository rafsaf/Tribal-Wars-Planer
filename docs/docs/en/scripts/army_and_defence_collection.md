## Installation

It proceeds identically as with all scripts for the bar; you need to paste the content into a newly created script for the bar in the game.

## Usage Instructions

1. Create a script for the bar, click it
2. Wait for the result
3. Go to the selected schedule
4. Paste the data and confirm

![Example output of the script](image-2.png)

## Description

After clicking, a "counter" with progress appears in the middle of the screen, then the result in a window. It works in both the Army and Defense tabs. The default settings for copying have cache set to true and cacheTime to 5 minutes. During this time, the script outputs the result saved in the browser instead of flying around all members and collecting data anew. In case of doubt whether we are dealing with a new or old result, the collection date appears at the bottom.

The data generated by running the script should be pasted into the schedule on the site.

Options:

Configuration takes place by using object **COLLECT_TROOPS_DATA_V2**. Note every parameter IS OPTIONAL, if both variables are
undefined or are defined, but there are no keys there, sensible
defaults will be used.

- **cache**: <boolean> (default: `true`) is responsible for storing the result
  in the browser so as not to accidentally click a few times in a row and
  load the game servers, setting cache: false causes not to store the result
  (eg, when we intend to collect data from two tribes jumping immediately
  to the other). Note if the tribe has huge amount of villages, it may take way
  too much storage in localStorage (~max 5MB), beacuse of that limit is 1MB,
  if output is > 1MB, save to localStorage will be skipped.

- **cacheTime**: <number> (default: `5`) is the time of storing the result in
  the browser, in minutes.

- **removedPlayers**: <string> (default: `""`) here we enter the nicknames of players
  from whom we do not want to collect troops info, separating with semicolons as in
  the messages in game, e.g. "Rafsaf;kmic;someoneelse"

- **allowedPlayers**: <string> (default: `""`) here we enter the nicknames of players
  from whom ONLY! (if it's empty, all players in the tribe will be used) we want to
  collect troops info, separating with semicolons as in the messages in game,
  e.g. "Rafsaf;kmic;someoneelse"

- **language**: <string> (default: `"pl"`) this should be `"en"` or `"pl"`, if anything
  different is used, script will use english

- **showNicknamesTroops**: <boolean> (default: `false`) when set to true cause that
  at each line appears at its beginning additionally the nickname of the player,
  applies only in Troops tab, similar to showNicknamesDeff

- **showFirstLineTroops**: <boolean> (default: `false`) when set to true cause that
  at result additional line at the top will be added, that is specified by
  firstLineDeff variable, applies only in Troops tab, similar to showFirstLineDeff

- **firstLineTroops**: <string> (default: `""`) line that will be showed at the result top
  when showFirstLineTroops is true, applies only in Troops tab, similar to
  showNicknamesDeff

- **showNicknamesDeff**: <boolean> (default: `false`) when set to true cause that
  at each line appears at its beginning additionally the nickname of the player,
  applies only in Defence tab, similar to showNicknamesTroops

- **showFirstLineDeff**: <boolean> (default: `false`) when set to true cause that
  at result additional line at the top will be added, that is specified by
  firstLineDeff variable, applies only in Defence tab, similar to showFirstLineTroops

- **firstLineDeff**: <string> (default: `""`) line that will be showed at the result top
  when showFirstLineTroops is true, applies only in Defence tab, similar
  to firstLineTroops
